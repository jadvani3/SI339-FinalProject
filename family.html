    <p>My family is very big and I am very close to everyone, especially my grandparents and cousins. My family is originally from India, but my cousins and I have all grown up in New York. Growing up, my grandparents used to pick me up from school everyday. As an only child, I am very close to my parents but also have cousins who are like my siblings.</p>
